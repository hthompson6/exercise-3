# For posterity

I am leaving this here as this would be I would have this logic stored for the standard coding interview;
however, I wanted to see if I could go further and setup an api/document ETL. Python and Java have better
machine learning libraries and we would absolutely want to handle non-OCR compatible images as part of the ingest.

For example, https://fnih.org/sites/default/files/final/pdf/Evidentiary%20Criteria%20Framework%20Final%20Version%20Oct%2020%202016.pdf
this has an image which has hierarchical/temporal implications via their DAG on page 8.
